# HSV color thresholds for markers
# Red marker (head)
# Red in HSV can be around 0 or around 180 (cyclic range)
# Using very wide thresholds for Gazebo colors
red_hsv:
  lower: [0, 30, 30]    # Very wide range for red
  upper: [15, 255, 255]

# Blue marker (tail)
# Blue is usually in range 100-130, but may be less saturated in Gazebo
blue_hsv:
  lower: [95, 30, 30]  # Very low saturation and brightness thresholds
  upper: [135, 255, 255]
